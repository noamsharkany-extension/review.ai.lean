# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The review analyzer system currently fails to extract reviews from Google Maps pages that are served in Hebrew due to geolocation-based language detection. Even when users have English browsers, Google Maps serves content in Hebrew for businesses located in Israel, causing the scraper to fail to extract review content despite being able to identify review sections. This system will focus on supporting English and Hebrew languages specifically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with an English browser, I want to analyze reviews from international businesses, so that I can get insights regardless of the local language Google Maps uses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a Google Maps URL for a business in Israel THEN the system SHALL successfully extract reviews even if the page is served in Hebrew
2. WHEN the scraper detects Hebrew interface elements THEN it SHALL adapt its extraction strategy to handle Hebrew content
3. WHEN review extraction fails due to Hebrew language barriers THEN the system SHALL attempt to force English language settings before retrying

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the scraper to handle geolocation-based language switching, so that the system works reliably for international businesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Maps serves a page in Hebrew THEN the scraper SHALL detect the language and adjust selectors accordingly
2. WHEN the initial extraction fails due to language issues THEN the system SHALL attempt to reload the page with English language parameters
3. WHEN language detection occurs THEN the system SHALL log the detected language for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust language detection and fallback mechanisms, so that the scraper can handle Hebrew and English languages that Google Maps serves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper loads a Google Maps page THEN it SHALL detect the page language within the first 5 seconds
2. WHEN non-English content is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt multiple extraction strategies including English URL parameters
3. WHEN all language-specific strategies fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information about the detected language and failed selectors
