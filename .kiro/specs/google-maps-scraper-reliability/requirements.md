# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google Maps review scraper currently suffers from reliability issues where it fails to extract reviews despite successfully navigating to review sections. The system finds visual elements (like star ratings) but fails to extract the actual review content, resulting in 0 reviews extracted even when reviews are visible on the page. This occurs due to resource loading failures, selector brittleness, and inadequate extraction strategy robustness. The system needs enhanced reliability mechanisms to handle Google Maps' dynamic content loading and evolving DOM structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user analyzing Google Maps reviews, I want the scraper to successfully extract reviews even when some page resources fail to load, so that I can get reliable review data regardless of network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper encounters resource loading failures (net::ERR_FAILED) THEN it SHALL continue extraction attempts using available DOM content
2. WHEN star elements are found but rating elements are missing THEN the system SHALL use alternative extraction strategies to find review data
3. WHEN initial selectors fail to find review content THEN the system SHALL progressively expand selector strategies until reviews are found or all strategies are exhausted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust selector strategies that adapt to Google Maps' changing DOM structure, so that the scraper remains functional when Google updates their interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN primary selectors fail to find reviews THEN the system SHALL attempt at least 3 different selector strategies before declaring failure
2. WHEN review elements are detected but extraction fails THEN the system SHALL analyze the DOM structure and suggest updated selectors
3. WHEN extraction strategies are exhausted THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information about what was found vs. what was expected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging scraper issues, I want comprehensive diagnostic information about extraction failures, so that I can quickly identify and fix selector or strategy issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL capture and log the complete DOM structure of the reviews section
2. WHEN selectors find partial matches (e.g., stars but not ratings) THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis of what elements were found and why extraction failed
3. WHEN resource loading fails THEN the system SHALL log which resources failed and attempt extraction with degraded functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with slow or unreliable internet, I want the scraper to handle network issues gracefully, so that temporary connectivity problems don't prevent review extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network resources fail to load THEN the system SHALL wait for essential content to load before attempting extraction
2. WHEN page loading is incomplete THEN the system SHALL retry extraction up to 3 times with increasing wait intervals
3. WHEN critical review content is still loading THEN the system SHALL wait up to 30 seconds for dynamic content to appear before failing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user analyzing reviews from different Google Maps interfaces, I want the scraper to work across mobile and desktop versions, so that I can extract reviews regardless of how Google serves the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google serves mobile-optimized content THEN the system SHALL detect the interface type and use appropriate selectors
2. WHEN the page uses different CSS class names or structure THEN the system SHALL adapt extraction methods based on detected page patterns
3. WHEN review layout differs from expected format THEN the system SHALL use content-based extraction rather than relying solely on CSS selectors
