# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google Maps review scraper currently extracts only the initially visible reviews (typically 5-10 reviews) from a business page. Users need comprehensive review collection that gathers 100 recent reviews, 100 worst-rated reviews, and 100 best-rated reviews (all unique) to perform thorough sentiment analysis and business intelligence. This requires implementing review sorting navigation, enhanced pagination, and deduplication logic while maintaining the existing reliability framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to collect 100 recent reviews from a Google Maps business page, so that I can analyze current customer sentiment and recent trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request recent reviews THEN the system SHALL navigate to the "Most recent" or "Newest" sorting option
2. WHEN collecting recent reviews THEN the system SHALL paginate through multiple pages until 100 unique reviews are collected or no more reviews are available
3. WHEN fewer than 100 recent reviews exist THEN the system SHALL collect all available recent reviews and report the actual count

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality analyst, I want to collect 100 worst-rated reviews from a Google Maps business page, so that I can identify common complaints and service issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request worst reviews THEN the system SHALL navigate to the "Lowest rated" or similar sorting option
2. WHEN collecting worst reviews THEN the system SHALL paginate through multiple pages until 100 unique low-rated reviews are collected
3. WHEN the business has fewer than 100 low-rated reviews THEN the system SHALL collect all available worst reviews and report the actual count

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reputation manager, I want to collect 100 best-rated reviews from a Google Maps business page, so that I can understand what customers appreciate most about the business.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request best reviews THEN the system SHALL navigate to the "Highest rated" or similar sorting option
2. WHEN collecting best reviews THEN the system SHALL paginate through multiple pages until 100 unique high-rated reviews are collected
3. WHEN the business has fewer than 100 high-rated reviews THEN the system SHALL collect all available best reviews and report the actual count

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want all collected reviews to be unique across the three categories (recent, worst, best), so that my analysis doesn't include duplicate reviews that could skew results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviews are collected from multiple sorting categories THEN the system SHALL use review IDs or content hashes to ensure uniqueness
2. WHEN a review appears in multiple categories THEN the system SHALL include it only once and prioritize based on collection order (recent > worst > best)
3. WHEN deduplication reduces the total count THEN the system SHALL report both the raw collection count and final unique count

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with various Google Maps interfaces, I want the comprehensive collection to work across mobile and desktop versions, so that I can collect reviews regardless of how Google serves the sorting options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Maps displays different sorting interfaces THEN the system SHALL detect and adapt to mobile vs desktop sorting controls
2. WHEN sorting options have different labels or locations THEN the system SHALL use multiple selector strategies to find and click sorting controls
3. WHEN sorting navigation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to collecting available reviews without sorting and report the limitation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive collection to maintain the existing reliability features, so that resource loading issues don't prevent large-scale review collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comprehensive collection encounters resource loading failures THEN the system SHALL continue using the existing degraded mode capabilities
2. WHEN pagination fails during comprehensive collection THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative pagination strategies before failing
3. WHEN collection is interrupted THEN the system SHALL return all successfully collected reviews rather than failing completely

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want comprehensive collection to be efficient and provide progress updates, so that I can monitor long-running collection operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comprehensive collection is running THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates showing current category and review count
2. WHEN collection takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL implement reasonable timeouts and memory management
3. WHEN collection completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report showing reviews collected per category and total unique reviews
