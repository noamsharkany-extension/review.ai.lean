I'd never seen such a thick meringue on a rhubarb tart! The place is popular, so it's busy and a little noisy, but the decor and the beauty of the pastries quickly make up for it!

The food is a matter of luck: some are very good, others are cold salads with questionable flavor, especially for those accustomed to Italian cuisine. Wonderful cakes. Friendly service and a beautiful interior.

On August 6th, during our visit to Colmar, we attempted to have a meal at this restaurant. I initially informed a female staff member that our party consisted of six people. Shortly after, another friend from our group also mentioned to her that we were six in total. In response, a light-skinned, light-eyed woman abruptly told us, ‚ÄúWe are not serving you, service is closed,‚Äù and essentially ushered us out. Her manner was shockingly rude and discourteous. I strongly suspect this treatment was due to us being foreigners. She kept raising her voice and displaying aggressive behavior. In a location so popular with tourists, such conduct towards customers is completely unacceptable. If they have no intention of serving tourists, they should reconsider operating in this area. What a disgraceful and blatantly racist restaurant.

At that point, the light-skinned, light-eyed woman said, ‚ÄúThere is no service for you, service is closed,‚Äù and effectively asked us to leave. Her attitude was extremely rude and disrespectful. I believe her behavior was because we were foreigners. She was constantly shouting and acting aggressively. In such a touristic location, treating customers this way is unacceptable. If they do not wish to serve tourists, they should not be in business here.

DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE A DOG OR SMALL CHILDREN We were waiting to be seated at this cafe for some breakfast with our 8 month old dachshund puppy when the cafe owners dog (wired dachshund), who was off the lead, came over to us and violently attacked our sweet boy completely unprovoked. Their dog has left our dog with permanent damage to his nostril and above his lip which was pouring with blood at the time. The owners of the cafe didn‚Äôt even tell us it was their dog originally and, despite me hysterically crying, neither of them offered us an apology and even had the audacity to tell us ‚Äòdogs will be dogs‚Äô when we went back to get their details and came as no shock to the owners which suggests this dog may have done it before and by no doubt will absolutely do it again. Even once my husband has picked up our puppy, their dog was at our feet trying to get to him. If you have a small child or dog I would not risk eating here, the dog was still off lead when we later returned for their information. When we asked who owned the dog, the owner told me he didn‚Äôt speak English and disappeared (which he certainly did as we then had a very clear conversation over the fact I would be reporting the attack to colmar city hall) This dog should not be allowed on the premises. My fear is that another dog or child will be next, you‚Äôve been warned - enter at your own risk. We got off lucky but the next person might not be. The owners are the problem. If you dog is not friendly how can you possibly let it roam freely around guests, children and dogs?

Beautiful place but very bad behaviour from the staff especially from the older lady .. we went there early in the morning during Christmas and I really wanted to catch a seat in front of the window to take some beautiful photos of the view outside etc for my blog for Colmar.. when we reached there the front seats were taken but we sat in the second row waiting for someone to leave and change seats. First of all they didn‚Äôt come to take our order even though we were right next to the bar , and when after a long time , they finally brought the order , the table in front became available so we took our coffees and changed . They came to us and even though we had already sat in the other table with our stuff , coats, bags etc, they forced us to move back to our previous seats !! This is the first time this happened to me .. I understand that they may don‚Äôt want to carry our food and drinks in some restaurants and change seats but in this case we had just received our order and we carried it by ourselves and anyway we were already in the new seats . It was very rude to ask as move back again Anyway we didn‚Äôt say anything even though we felt embarrassed in front of everyone . Then when we finally wanted to leave , I asked for the bill about 3 times as we had to go and they keep laughing and talking with other costumers so I went to the cashier in order to pay as we had to leave quickly and guess what .. SHE ASKED ME FOR THE SECOND TIME to go back to my table because they won‚Äôt let me pay on the cashier , only at the waiter on my table The worst experience in the whole Colmar and Strasbourg . üëéüëéüëé

Lovely atmosphere. There are teddy bears of all shapes and sizes in every corner which is quite charming. The food and service was good; recommend the goat cheese salad. The desserts looked amazing! The wait staff spoke German and English in addition to French, however, only French menus were available.

Very well located in the old town, a very friendly welcome, and local dishes. I think it's also a bit like the local shopkeepers' canteen. I wanted to try the liver dumplings, and I didn't regret my choice‚Äîexcellent!

A wonderful culinary experience in the heart of Colmar. Friendly service even with a large crowd. The tarts deserve their name; they're generous and delicious. The white tart stood up very well with homemade whipped cream.
