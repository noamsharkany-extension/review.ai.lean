# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create resource loading monitor foundation
  - Implement `ResourceLoadingMonitor` class to track page resource loading status
  - Add detection for failed CSS, JavaScript, and font resources that affect review rendering
  - Create degraded mode detection when critical Google Maps resources fail to load
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Implement progressive selector strategy engine
  - Create `ProgressiveSelectorEngine` with 4-tier fallback system (primary → secondary → content-based → brute-force)
  - Define multiple selector sets for different Google Maps interface versions and layouts
  - Add validation logic to verify extraction quality before accepting results
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Add enhanced DOM analysis and diagnostics
  - Implement comprehensive DOM structure analysis to distinguish visual stars from rating data elements
  - Create diagnostic reporting that captures why star elements are found but rating elements aren't
  - Add screenshot capture and DOM snapshot functionality for debugging failed extractions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Create content-based extraction fallback system
  - Implement pattern-based review extraction that doesn't rely on CSS selectors
  - Add text pattern recognition for author names, ratings, dates, and review content
  - Create confidence scoring for content-based extraction results
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 5.3_

- [x] 5. Implement network resilience and retry mechanisms
  - Add intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff for resource loading failures
  - Create timeout handling that waits for dynamic content to load before extraction
  - Implement partial content extraction when page loading is incomplete
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Add interface detection and adaptive extraction
  - Implement detection for mobile vs desktop Google Maps interfaces
  - Create adaptive selector strategies based on detected page layout and version
  - Add support for different CSS class naming patterns across Google Maps updates
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 7. Enhance existing scraper service with reliability framework
  - Integrate resource loading monitor into existing `GoogleReviewScraperService`
  - Replace single-strategy extraction with progressive selector engine
  - Add diagnostic capture to all extraction attempts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive extraction validation system
  - Implement validation logic that checks extraction completeness and quality
  - Add cross-validation between different extraction strategies
  - Create automatic retry triggers when validation fails
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 9. Implement detailed logging and monitoring
  - Add structured logging for all extraction attempts, failures, and successes
  - Create performance metrics tracking for different extraction strategies
  - Implement alerting for systematic extraction failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 10. Create unit tests for reliability components
  - Write tests for resource loading monitor with simulated network failures
  - Test progressive selector engine with different DOM structures
  - Create tests for content-based extraction with various review formats
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1_

- [x] 11. Implement integration tests with real failure scenarios
  - Create tests using URLs that exhibit resource loading failures
  - Test extraction with deliberately broken CSS/JavaScript resources
  - Implement tests for the specific star elements vs rating elements mismatch issue
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 12. Add performance optimization and caching
  - Implement caching for DOM analysis results to avoid repeated computation
  - Optimize selector strategy execution to minimize page interaction time
  - Add memory management for diagnostic data collection
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 13. Create diagnostic analysis tools
  - Implement tools to analyze diagnostic reports and suggest selector improvements
  - Create automated detection of new Google Maps interface changes
  - Add reporting dashboard for extraction success rates and failure patterns
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 14. Implement emergency fallback extraction mode
  - Create minimal extraction mode that works even when most resources fail
  - Add basic text scraping capabilities for when all selector strategies fail
  - Implement user notification system for degraded extraction quality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 15. Add real-world testing and validation
  - Test with the specific URLs that currently fail (like the KFC example from debug logs)
  - Validate that star elements vs rating elements mismatch is resolved
  - Perform load testing to ensure reliability improvements don't impact performance
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.2_
