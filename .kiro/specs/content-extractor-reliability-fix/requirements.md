# Content Extractor Reliability Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google Maps scraper is experiencing critical failures due to a `__name is not defined` error in the ContentBasedExtractor service. This error is causing complete extraction failures, preventing the system from collecting any reviews even when the page loads successfully. The error appears to be occurring during page evaluation in the content-based extraction process, which is the fallback mechanism when selector-based extraction fails.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical ContentBasedExtractor Error

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ContentBasedExtractor to handle page evaluation errors gracefully, so that the scraper doesn't fail completely when encountering JavaScript execution issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ContentBasedExtractor encounters a `__name is not defined` error THEN the system SHALL catch the error and log it appropriately
2. WHEN page evaluation fails in the ContentBasedExtractor THEN the system SHALL return an empty result instead of throwing an exception
3. WHEN JavaScript execution errors occur during content extraction THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages for debugging
4. WHEN the ContentBasedExtractor fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative extraction methods if available
5. WHEN page evaluation code is executed THEN it SHALL only use JavaScript/TypeScript compatible syntax and avoid Python-style references

### Requirement 2: Improve Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling in the content extraction pipeline, so that I can identify and fix issues quickly without complete system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any extraction method fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
2. WHEN page evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL capture the specific JavaScript error and context
3. WHEN content extraction encounters errors THEN the system SHALL attempt graceful degradation to simpler extraction methods
4. WHEN multiple extraction attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive error report
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about each extraction step

### Requirement 3: Enhance Content-Based Extraction Robustness

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the content-based extraction to work reliably across different page states and loading conditions, so that reviews can be extracted even when the page structure changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is in a degraded loading state THEN the content extractor SHALL still attempt to find review content
2. WHEN DOM elements are not fully loaded THEN the system SHALL wait for essential content before extraction
3. WHEN page evaluation encounters serialization issues THEN the system SHALL use alternative data passing methods
4. WHEN RegExp patterns need to be passed to page evaluation THEN the system SHALL serialize and deserialize them safely
5. WHEN content extraction finds no reviews THEN the system SHALL return an empty result with appropriate confidence scores

### Requirement 4: Implement Fallback Extraction Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want multiple fallback mechanisms for review extraction, so that the system can still collect data even when primary methods fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ContentBasedExtractor fails THEN the system SHALL attempt basic text pattern matching
2. WHEN page evaluation is not possible THEN the system SHALL use server-side content analysis
3. WHEN all extraction methods fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
4. WHEN extraction confidence is low THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative approaches
5. WHEN network issues affect page loading THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5: Add Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging and monitoring of the extraction process, so that I can identify patterns in failures and optimize the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction processes run THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and success rates
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error categories, frequencies, and contexts
3. WHEN page evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL capture browser console errors and warnings
4. WHEN extraction methods are attempted THEN the system SHALL track which methods succeed or fail
5. WHEN debugging information is collected THEN the system SHALL store it for analysis and troubleshooting
