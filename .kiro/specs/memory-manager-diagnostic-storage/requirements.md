# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google Maps scraper is currently failing with the error "this.memoryManager.storeDiagnosticData is not a function". Multiple services throughout the application are attempting to call a `storeDiagnosticData` method on the `MemoryManager` class, but this method doesn't exist. This is causing complete scraper failure and preventing any review extraction from working.

The issue affects critical services including DOM analysis, diagnostic analysis, reporting dashboard, and interface change detection services. This is a blocking bug that needs immediate resolution to restore scraper functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the scraper system, I want the MemoryManager to properly store diagnostic data, so that the scraper can function without throwing "method not found" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service calls `memoryManager.storeDiagnosticData()` THEN the system SHALL execute the method without throwing an error
2. WHEN diagnostic data is stored THEN the system SHALL persist the data in memory with proper organization
3. WHEN diagnostic data is stored THEN the system SHALL respect memory limits and cleanup old data automatically
4. WHEN diagnostic data is stored with priority levels THEN the system SHALL handle different priority levels appropriately
5. WHEN multiple services store diagnostic data simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access safely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring scraper performance, I want to retrieve stored diagnostic data, so that I can analyze system behavior and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnostic data is requested by ID THEN the system SHALL return the stored data if it exists
2. WHEN diagnostic data is requested by URL THEN the system SHALL return all related diagnostic entries
3. WHEN diagnostic data is requested by priority THEN the system SHALL filter results by priority level
4. WHEN diagnostic data is requested with time range THEN the system SHALL return entries within the specified timeframe
5. WHEN no diagnostic data matches the criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty result without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system monitoring the memory usage, I want diagnostic data storage to be memory-efficient, so that storing diagnostic information doesn't cause memory issues itself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnostic data storage exceeds memory limits THEN the system SHALL automatically remove oldest entries
2. WHEN diagnostic data is stored THEN the system SHALL compress or optimize large data structures
3. WHEN memory cleanup is triggered THEN the system SHALL include diagnostic data in cleanup operations
4. WHEN diagnostic data reaches maximum entries THEN the system SHALL use LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
5. WHEN diagnostic data storage is queried for memory usage THEN the system SHALL report accurate storage statistics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service integrating with MemoryManager, I want consistent diagnostic data storage interface, so that all services can store diagnostic information in a standardized way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing diagnostic data THEN the system SHALL accept parameters: id, url, data, priority
2. WHEN priority is not specified THEN the system SHALL use a default priority level
3. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN data is null or undefined THEN the system SHALL handle the case without crashing
5. WHEN the storage interface is called THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing service calls
