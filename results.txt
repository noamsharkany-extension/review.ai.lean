⚠️AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE⚠️ This Saturday, August 30, an incompetent employee I presume to be a "manager" did nothing but insult another employee and shouted loudly, "I don't give a damn about customers, I'm on a break." Thank you, that's nice, we won't be back then ☺️. "Yes, you don't know who I am." No, that's a very good question because to have such a head, I hope you're very high up, even if with behavior like that, it would surprise me a lot. So, atmosphere and service are ZERO, as far as the food is concerned, it could be better. But I'm telling you again, AVOID!!!

Very well located in the old town, a very friendly welcome, and local dishes. I think it's also a bit like the local shopkeepers' canteen. I wanted to try the liver dumplings, and I didn't regret my choice—excellent!

Beware of scams! On the table, a small slate reads "30cl mulled wine €4.20." We order two. We are served a small 20cl glass. We make a nice little remark at the end of the meal. Without any qualms, the waitress brings us the bill without change; I find that really inflated. Do we have to be unpleasant?

DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE A DOG OR SMALL CHILDREN We were waiting to be seated at this cafe for some breakfast with our 8 month old dachshund puppy when the cafe owners dog (wired dachshund), who was off the lead, came over to us and violently attacked our sweet boy completely unprovoked. Their dog has left our dog with permanent damage to his nostril and above his lip which was pouring with blood at the time. The owners of the cafe didn’t even tell us it was their dog originally and, despite me hysterically crying, neither of them offered us an apology and even had the audacity to tell us ‘dogs will be dogs’ when we went back to get their details and came as no shock to the owners which suggests this dog may have done it before and by no doubt will absolutely do it again. Even once my husband has picked up our puppy, their dog was at our feet trying to get to him. If you have a small child or dog I would not risk eating here, the dog was still off lead when we later returned for their information. When we asked who owned the dog, the owner told me he didn’t speak English and disappeared (which he certainly did as we then had a very clear conversation over the fact I would be reporting the attack to colmar city hall) This dog should not be allowed on the premises. My fear is that another dog or child will be next, you’ve been warned - enter at your own risk. We got off lucky but the next person might not be. The owners are the problem. If you dog is not friendly how can you possibly let it roam freely around guests, children and dogs?

Beautiful place but very bad behaviour from the staff especially from the older lady .. we went there early in the morning during Christmas and I really wanted to catch a seat in front of the window to take some beautiful photos of the view outside etc for my blog for Colmar.. when we reached there the front seats were taken but we sat in the second row waiting for someone to leave and change seats. First of all they didn’t come to take our order even though we were right next to the bar , and when after a long time , they finally brought the order , the table in front became available so we took our coffees and changed . They came to us and even though we had already sat in the other table with our stuff , coats, bags etc, they forced us to move back to our previous seats !! This is the first time this happened to me .. I understand that they may don’t want to carry our food and drinks in some restaurants and change seats but in this case we had just received our order and we carried it by ourselves and anyway we were already in the new seats . It was very rude to ask as move back again Anyway we didn’t say anything even though we felt embarrassed in front of everyone . Then when we finally wanted to leave , I asked for the bill about 3 times as we had to go and they keep laughing and talking with other costumers so I went to the cashier in order to pay as we had to leave quickly and guess what .. SHE ASKED ME FOR THE SECOND TIME to go back to my table because they won’t let me pay on the cashier , only at the waiter on my table The worst experience in the whole Colmar and Strasbourg . 👎👎👎

I had a reservation. I am a single older woman. As I have discovered in other places, if you are by yourself you are put in the worse seats away from the sunny windows and best seats. It was obvious I was not a valued customer. Just because I am older and by myself it does not mean I should not have a choice seat. I advise others to avoid these restaurants. Shame on you. And, the steak was not good. Way too tough.

We took a seat by the window and the service was so quick and friendly. We had tea and coffee served in gorgeous cups and a slice of the most delicious blueberry pie I’ve ever tasted !!!

Hello, the place is easy to find, a bit crowded when there's no pandemic:). The serving is fast, the prices are right like medium high, the personnel trying to be nice and the food was great! Enjoy it!
