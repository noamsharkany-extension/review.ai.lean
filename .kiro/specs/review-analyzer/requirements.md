# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Review.ai is a smart review analyzer that scrapes and analyzes Google Reviews from Google Maps URLs to provide users with trustworthy, actionable insights. The system intelligently samples large review datasets, performs sentiment analysis, detects fake reviews, and identifies sentiment mismatches to deliver a comprehensive verdict that helps users make informed decisions about businesses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a Google Maps URL and receive an analysis of the business reviews, so that I can make informed decisions based on trustworthy review data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid Google Maps URL THEN the system SHALL extract and scrape all available reviews from that location
2. WHEN the URL is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
3. WHEN reviews are successfully scraped THEN the system SHALL proceed to the analysis phase automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently sample reviews when there are too many, so that I get representative analysis without overwhelming processing time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are more than 300 reviews THEN the system SHALL sample exactly 100 recent reviews, 100 five-star reviews, and 100 one-star reviews
2. WHEN there are 300 or fewer reviews THEN the system SHALL analyze all available reviews
3. WHEN sampling occurs THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate in the final report that sampling was used and explain the sampling methodology

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress updates during analysis, so that I understand what the system is doing and can trust the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis begins THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators for each phase: scraping reviews, filtering & sampling, analyzing sentiment, detecting fake reviews, and building verdict
2. WHEN each phase completes THEN the system SHALL update the progress indicator to show completion
3. WHEN any phase encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display the specific error and allow the user to retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive sentiment analysis of reviews, so that I can understand the true sentiment behind star ratings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing reviews THEN the system SHALL perform sentiment analysis on the review text content
2. WHEN sentiment analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify reviews where star rating doesn't match text sentiment (e.g., 1-star with positive text)
3. WHEN sentiment mismatches are found THEN the system SHALL count and report the number of mismatched reviews in the final verdict

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want fake and bot review detection, so that I can trust the authenticity of the review analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing reviews THEN the system SHALL detect potentially fake or bot-generated reviews using pattern recognition
2. WHEN fake reviews are detected THEN the system SHALL count and report the percentage of likely fake reviews
3. WHEN fake review detection is complete THEN the system SHALL exclude fake reviews from overall sentiment scoring but include them in the transparency report

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive dashboard with final verdict and scores, so that I can quickly understand the business reputation and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display a final verdict with overall impression score, trustworthiness score, and red flags score
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show sampling breakdown, trust score, fake review ratio, and sentiment mismatch ratio
3. WHEN presenting the verdict THEN the system SHALL be deterministic and specific, never vague or uncertain

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want full transparency with citations for every analyzed review, so that I can verify the analysis and trust the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide citations for each review analyzed including link, full review text, star rating, and specific analysis
2. WHEN showing analysis results THEN the system SHALL display accuracy and confidence scores for each analytical component
3. WHEN presenting citations THEN the system SHALL ensure all source links are functional and lead back to the original reviews

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular architecture separating scraping, processing, reasoning, and output, so that the system can be easily extended to support other review platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN the architecture SHALL clearly separate scraping logic, data processing, analysis reasoning, and output generation
2. WHEN designing components THEN each module SHALL have well-defined interfaces that allow for future platform extensions (Yelp, TripAdvisor)
3. WHEN building the system THEN the code SHALL be production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and scalability considerations
