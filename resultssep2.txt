⚠️AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE⚠️ This Saturday, August 30, an incompetent employee I presume to be a "manager" did nothing but insult another employee and shouted loudly, "I don't give a damn about customers, I'm on a break." Thank you, that's nice, we won't be back then ☺️. "Yes, you don't know who I am." No, that's a very good question because to have such a head, I hope you're very high up, even if with behavior like that, it would surprise me a lot. So, atmosphere and service are ZERO, as far as the food is concerned, it could be better. But I'm telling you again, AVOID!!!

Very well located in the old town, a very friendly welcome, and local dishes. I think it's also a bit like the local shopkeepers' canteen. I wanted to try the liver dumplings, and I didn't regret my choice—excellent!

Exceptionally rude. Made reservations before.

Beautiful place but very bad behaviour from the staff especially from the older lady .. we went there early in the morning during Christmas and I really wanted to catch a seat in front of the window to take some beautiful photos of the view outside etc for my blog for Colmar.. when we reached there the front seats were taken but we sat in the second row waiting for someone to leave and change seats. First of all they didn’t come to take our order even though we were right next to the bar , and when after a long time , they finally brought the order , the table in front became available so we took our coffees and changed . They came to us and even though we had already sat in the other table with our stuff , coats, bags etc, they forced us to move back to our previous seats !! This is the first time this happened to me .. I understand that they may don’t want to carry our food and drinks in some restaurants and change seats but in this case we had just received our order and we carried it by ourselves and anyway we were already in the new seats . It was very rude to ask as move back again Anyway we didn’t say anything even though we felt embarrassed in front of everyone . Then when we finally wanted to leave , I asked for the bill about 3 times as we had to go and they keep laughing and talking with other costumers so I went to the cashier in order to pay as we had to leave quickly and guess what .. SHE ASKED ME FOR THE SECOND TIME to go back to my table because they won’t let me pay on the cashier , only at the waiter on my table The worst experience in the whole Colmar and Strasbourg . 👎👎👎

I had a reservation. I am a single older woman. As I have discovered in other places, if you are by yourself you are put in the worse seats away from the sunny windows and best seats. It was obvious I was not a valued customer. Just because I am older and by myself it does not mean I should not have a choice seat. I advise others to avoid these restaurants. Shame on you. And, the steak was not good. Way too tough.
