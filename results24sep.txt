Overall, a nice place. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the food we ordered last time. It was very mediocre and the price was not cheap. Sitting in the place, the food is much tastier. But in my opinion, a high-level place should also know how to control food delivery at a high level or not offer the service.

We was wondering at the restaurant trying to look where to go to find our friend . Food arrived we ordered a lots of starter one of them was the chicken bun we find pice of metal inside!!! So this did not add to our experience from the beginning. Food very average i ordered the fish in red curry was very bland!!! Not good !!! And expensive for nothing!!! Do yourself a favor spend your money in a different restaurant in Tel Aviv and there is so good restaurants in! that city !!! but definitely not this one !!!one word disappointment!!!!

They offer outside seats. This option is as close as you can to sit in hell. 0 options to cool yourself. I could not finish my dish due to the extreme heat. The staff kept promising they will boost the air conditioning but did nothing about that and the poor air conditioner seemed like it is just not working.

Horrible. Took 3 dishes. The tom yum soup which was bland (Even the mediocre Japanica does it better), the Ramen was exceptionally spicy to the point it was uneatable. The crunchy sushi was ok but no more (and costs twice as much as sushis in other sushi places). The waiters did not care that I barely ate my food and just suggested to take it away instead of asking me if everything was alright. All in all, bad service and pretty bad food. Would not return. Would not return.

Really nice place for sushi! The food is good, the fish are fresh. The pricing is fair, given that it's good sushi. The service is wonderful, and the location is really nice.

One of the best sushi places in TLV. The sushi is FRESH. They have many, many tasty vegan options, including an amazing dessert. It‚Äôs on the expensive side, but worth it!

One of the best places to eat sushi in Israel and other dishes too, I've tried countless dishes at this place and never got disappointed. Although it's a bit of an expensive place, it's worth every shekel!

The best shusi I ate in Tel-Aviv. The takeaway is not as good as sitting in the restaurant. Normally there is a long queue, so reserve a place in advance.

Sushi bar place. Food is good but price is not cheap as per other sushi bars in israel. Atmosphere and service is very good. Reservations are recommended as weekends can be quite crowded

The variety of pasta is great. Curry sauce is delicious. Prices are reasonable. Portions are usually OK, depending on how famished you are. Same as other locations on this chain.

This place was a pleasant surprise. I love sushi and usually find myself at Onami but fu sushi tasted damn good. I think the way i described it was 'onami focuses on the quality of the fish while fu sushi focuses on the combination of tastes'. Both are good and are at the top in their own right.

Sushi & sashimi are authentic and delicious, served properly except for missing the dish to mix soy sauce with wasabi which was provided on request. Service was very good. Note; from over 20 years experience doing business in Japan, it is ‚Ä¶
